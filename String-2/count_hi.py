# Return the number of times that the string "hi" appears anywhere in the given string.


# count_hi('abc hi ho') → 1
# count_hi('ABChi hi') → 2
# count_hi('hihi') → 2

def count_hi(str):
  return str.count("hi")


# Our Solution:

def count_hi(str):
  sum = 0
  ## Loop to length-1 and access index i and i+1
  ## in the loop.
  for i in range(len(str)-1):
    if str[i:i+2] == 'hi':
      sum = sum + 1
  return sum
